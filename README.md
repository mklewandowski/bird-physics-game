# bird-physics-game
A simple bird tossing physics game based on Jason Weimann's terrific [Unity tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OR0e-1UBEOU). I made this game for practice after watching the tutorial. I simply wanted to see how fast I could recreate the game presented in the tutorial from memory. It ended up being a fun exercise. Feel free to use this as a starting point for a Angry Birds style physics game.

I made a few small tweaks and improvements, and I think I came pretty close to the content presented in the original tutorial.
1. I added a `Globals`` class to store level names and the current level.
2. I created 4 unique levels that the game cycles through.
3. I expanded the background horizontally for better readability.
4. I prevented trying to fling the bird again after the initial fling.
5. I added folders for asset organization.
